# Robust PCA with stationary camera analysis

This repository corresponds to the second project of the *Introduction to Convex Optimization* course given at Universidad de los Andes in the fall semester of 2016. The objective of this project is to apply Robust PCA to a set of stationary camera images to separate the background from the moving 
objects in the video. This project is based almost enterly on the paper: *http://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/papers/RobustPCA.pdf* writeen by Emanuel J. Cand√®s et al.
